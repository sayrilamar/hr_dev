1. Determine who your USER personas are.
2. Build personas
3. Interview or Survey
4. Analyze and refine all information into problem statement groups
5. Build 4-blocker with Value vs Complexity
6. Create Hypothesis and Assumption to build something to measure. (This is the beginning of the feedback loop)
7. Solution Prioritization (Prioritizing step 5.) Also known as "Solutioning".
8. Design Studio Session (Brainstorming Session). By Prioritized solution, have each individual have input in how they would create the solution. Take all of that info for each person and each problem statement, then start prototyping.
9. Using the prototypes, repeat Step 3.
10. Once a problem statement has been solutioned, create user stories for the developers to begin developing that part of the app.
