I wanted to create a template for how we build our personas by answering the following key points below:

This would be a persona user story template



1. Describe the users WHO will likely be using the app? (Quantitavive Data Collection)
  Who are the users?
  How many users are there?
  What do they do with the app?
  What are the differences among users? (groups)
2. How will the user FIND OUT about the app?
3. How will the app ENGAGE the user regularly?
4. What about the app will make the user RETURN frequently?
5. How can the user use the app to REFER others?
